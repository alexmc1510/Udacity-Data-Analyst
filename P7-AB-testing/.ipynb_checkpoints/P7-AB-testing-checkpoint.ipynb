    "- Number of user-id is the number of users who enroll in the free trial. It cannot be used as an invariant metric or evaluation metric. User-ids are only tracked only after a student enrolls in the free trial and will not be equally distributed between the control and experimental groups. Hence it cannot be used as an invariant metric. It is essentially number of enrollments and is a raw count. We cannot adjust raw count to differences in group sizes and we are already using Gross conversion to measure the impact on enrollments that can normalize. Gross conversion is more robust than number of user IDs since it is normalized to the unit of diversion. So I opted not to use Number of user-id as evaluation metric either.\n",
