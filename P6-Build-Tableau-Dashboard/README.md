# P6-Build-Tableau-Dashboard

A movie producer :clapper: wants to better understand film industry :movie_camera: trends before releasing its next movie. I will explore OMDB movie dataset and build Tableau dashboards to answer a set of questions and tell a story with data. My work will be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
