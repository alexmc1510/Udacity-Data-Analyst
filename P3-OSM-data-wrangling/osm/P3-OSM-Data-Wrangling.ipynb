In only 48 hours after the quake, over 2000 volunteers mapper responded to the crisis by quadrupling the road mileage and adding 30% more buildings. OSM is the biggest crowdsourced project ever. However, since the OSM data is human edited, it comes with it's own challenges for cleaning.\n",

    "* How do we build a robust data processing system ? With user entered data, there is bound to be variations and typgraphical errors. It will also be nice to have a well agreed form of data for input, as there are variations even within TIGER GPS data and GNIS data entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, OSM I believe, is about the community of volunteers from all around the globe. These mappers are updating the map as their world changes around them. The user statistics are however, skewed. In our case, we saw that top 10 users created around ~90% of the map. If the user data were displayed more prominently, it would likely motivate other users to submit more edits for the map. **Gamified approach to fixing OSM bugs** as adopted by [MapRoulette](http://maproulette.org/) and crowdsourced streetview approach by [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/) are commendable.       \n",

    "**Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mapping, fixing bugs, analyzing data will be quite fast with an army of mappers working on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This crowdsourcing approach would considerably reduce the cost. Imagine having to pay minimum US wage for the task.        \n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A common operational procedure has to be defined for managing the gamification approach, e.g incentives for users, tracking user activity, quality assurance etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do we get users from around the world to contribute on diverse geographical regions? How do we provide support on regional challenges? "
